Photo-album is a react app for documenting pictures.

- cd into the folder photo-album
- run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies
- run `npm start` to start the server<br /><br />

Next, witht the server started, follow these steps to start the app:
- clone this *photo-album* repository
